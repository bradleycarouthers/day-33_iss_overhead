# day-33_iss_overhead
Day 33 of 100.

Used an API from the international space station (ISS) to get it's longitude and latitude. The program was running in the background, so once it gets overhead (and at night), the I'll receive an email telling me to look up.

The Kanye West program also utilizes APIs. It also uses tkinter to have a GUI in which the user can click the Kanye button to display a different quote.
